- Clojure/Script's unique value prop is, imo:
	- default immutability
	- interop with host plastform ecosystem
	- metaprogramming/compilers (extend the language, e.g. can make "reactive lambda")
	- cross platform code sharing (i.e. unified client/server web app)
	- thin abstraction / worse is better
	- REPL / interactive development
