- What are the server requirements for electric?
	- Electric server currently targets the JVM.
	- Node as a server is not supported yet.
	- AWS lambda and serverless platforms are not supported yet, we'll take a look when a serious project brings us a specific use case.
	- Architecture wise we are most excited about edge networks like fly.io (that deploy dozens of flyweight servers across the globe in cities close to users) which means the Electric client and Electric server are sub-10ms apart.
