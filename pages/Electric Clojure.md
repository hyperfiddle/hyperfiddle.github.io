- Electric ([github repo](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric)) is a reactive Clojure DSL that simplifies full-stack web development by seamlessly merging frontend and backend code, using a **compiler** to manage the frontend/backend boundary. The compiler analyzes your unified codebase to infer the client/server boundary, and generate full-stack web apps with fully automatic network sync.

- *Figure: This is not RPC or client-side ORM. The Electric compiler performs deep graph analysis of your unified frontend/backend program to automatically determine the optimal network cut, and then compile it into separate client and server target programs that cooperate and anticipate each other's needs.*

- Key features and benefits:
	- **Unified codebase:** Electric programs interweave frontend and backend logic in the same expression, function, or file, reducing the complexity and cognitive load associated with managing separate codebases for each part of the application.
	- **Automatic client/server boundary inference:** Electric extends Clojure by building client/server awareness directly into the language itself, allowing you to write one body of code that seamlessly blends frontend and backend code in the same expression, same function, same file.
	- **Fully Reactive**: Electric integrates reactivity directly into the programming language itself. Reactive-if, reactive-for, reactive try/catch. When everything is reactive, it feels like nothing is reactive. No observables! No async types! De-load your mind and focus on writing clean and concise code.
	- **Streaming lexical scope:** Experience the power of seamlessly accessing values across client and server environments within the same scope. Electric's streaming lexical scope unifies your code and promotes readability, making it easier to maintain and understand the interactions between client and server components.
	- **Network-transparent composition:** Electric programs seamlessly compose functions that involve both client and server-side operations. The Electric compiler takes into account loops, recursion, closures, higher order functions, and deeply nested function calls, to determine the implied client/server boundary.
	- **Eliminate request waterfalls and N+1 problem:**
	- **Leverages the power of Clojure:** By extending Clojure, Electric inherits all of the language's powerful features, such as immutability, functional programming, seamless Java and JavaScript interop, cross-platform code sharing, and concise syntax, to create an expressive and productive full-stack web development experience.
