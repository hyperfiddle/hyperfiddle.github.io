- **Electric Clojure**
	- a distributed and reactive programming language
	- define a distributed program in Clojure
- **Clojure/Script**
	- hosts Electric Clojure/Script programs
- **Electric Compiler**
	- a Clojure -> IR (Immediate Representation) compiler
	- implemented as a Clojure/Script macro
- Electric IR
	- IR is the data structure or code used internally by a compiler or virtual machine to represent source code
	- for Electric, this is "graph bytecode" for a distributed & reactive program
- Electric VM
	- a distributed VM.
	- The VM models a computation spread across N concurrent sites (today N=2 - backend/frontend), with managed state sync.
	- Managed network means the concrete distributed program matches the semantics of the intended abstract program as defined the source code, regardless of where the actual computation happens or how the state got synced.
- Network planner
	- the part of the VM that finds the optimal cut
	- operates on IR
		- This is the same as Java: there are optimizations performed by the compiler and also the runtime.
		- PG as a query planner to choose the fastest query
		- Electric has a network planner to choose the optimal network transfers
	- the cut is computed at compile time, but will be runtime in the future
		- the compiler doesn't know everything; this is a major source of superfluous round trips today
			- dynamic linking - virtual methods - this is how lambdas work
	- today, we focus on correct semantics. Now that we are useful in production, we will use production learnings to implement a planner that optimizes for real world conditions.
- Electric Site Runtime
	- Platform target sites (brower, server) that participate in the distributed VM
- Missionary Reactor
	- FRP engine with glitch-free propagation
	- holds the actual runtime state of each site process
		- server state, one reactor per websocket session
		- client state, one reactor in the browser
	- Java, JS implementations
- JVM/Browser/Node
