- Electric Clojure (programming language) -> define a distributed program in Clojure
- Clojure/Script â€“ hosts Electric Clojure/Script programs
- Electric Compiler: a Clojure -> IR compiler (implemented as a Clojure/Script macro)
- Electric IR - "graph bytecode" for a reactive distributed program
- Electric VM - a distributed VM. The VM models a computation spread across N concurrent sites (today N=2 - backend/frontend), with managed state sync. Managed network means the concrete distributed program matches the semantics of the intended abstract program as defined the source code, regardless of where the actual computation happens or how the state got synced.
- Network planner - the part of the VM that finds the optimal cut
