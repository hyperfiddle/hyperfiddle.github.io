- # Simple configuration
	- `C-u M-x cider-jack-in-clj` — note the prefix argument!
		- Invoking with prefix arg lets you modify the cider command string to add the `dev` alias
		- Doom users with evil enabled will find the universal argument on SPC u instead than C-u
			- https://docs.doomemacs.org/latest/
	- append `":dev"` to end of the command string, like: `"-M:cider/nrepl:dev"`
-
- # Alternate configuration, contributed, old, unvalidated, please PR improvements
	- Create `.dir-locals.el`
		- ```
		  ((nil
		    (cider-clojure-cli-global-options . "-A:dev")
		    (cider-jack-in-nrepl-middlewares . ("cider.nrepl/cider-middleware" "shadow.cljs.devtools.server.nrepl/middleware")))) 
		  ```
		- .dir-locals.el has some project-specific config. When you first open a Clojure file, you'll be prompted to allow that config to be applied. Answer `y`.
		- Then, to jack in: `M-x sesman-start`; Choose `cider-jack-in-clj`; "Your Clojure REPL is connected"
		- Starting a CLJS REPL:
		- Start a CLJS build from the Clojure REPL `(user/main)`
		- `M-x cider-connect-sibling-cljs`
		- Select `shadow` and the name of the shadow build `:devkit`
		- http://localhost:8080 ; "Your ClojureScript REPL is connected!"
	- When inside of a CLJC file, evaluations will be sent to both REPLs. So be sure to wrap anything platform specific in reader conditionals before evaluating them. Inline results only show a single result, so whichever REPL returns slower wins. `prn` is your friend if you want to see evaluation results, as it will print in each REPL buffer the result from that environment.
	- To prevent being prompted to apply the local variables on every file you open:
		- Run `M-x customize` and search for `safe-local-variable-values`
		- Add a new entry for `cider-jack-in-nrepl-middlewares`, with the value that is in `.dir-locals.el`. E.g. `("cider.nrepl/cider-middleware" "shadow.cljs.devtools.server.nrepl/middleware")`
		- Apply and save in the customize buffer
