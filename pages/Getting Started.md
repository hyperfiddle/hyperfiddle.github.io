- Start by running the demos on your machine. They also serve as tutorials. You should read and understand each one, they are designed for teaching!
-
- # How to run the demos
	- `git clone git@github.com:hyperfiddle/electric.git`
	- `cd electric`
	- `clj -A:dev -X user/main` — serves demos at http://localhost:8080
	- [src-docs](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric/tree/master/src-docs) folder has the demos, please explore!
		- please explore!
		- view them in the order that they are listed at http://localhost:8080

- # How to jack into REPL with demos
	- Jack in with `dev` alias
		- do NOT let your editor auto-start a shadow-cljs build, just use an ordinary Clojure REPL. It's critical that shadow-cljs share the same JVM as your editor REPL, otherwise the Electric frontend and backend code will disalign and you will see weird errors
	- run `(main)` from `user.clj` to compile and serve the app
		- (main) will run shadow
		- see [src-dev/user.clj](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric/blob/master/src-dev/user.clj) and [user.cljs](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric/blob/master/src-dev/user.cljs)
-
- # IDE setup
	- [[Cursive IDE setup]]
	- [[Emacs IDE setup]]
	- use shadow hot code reloading
	- it's not enough to send form to repl, due to how the compiler works (we can probably fix it )
	- deep def works, println works
