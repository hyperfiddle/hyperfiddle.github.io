- Do the tutorial. Then clone one of the starter apps.

- # Tutorial
	- Tutorial app: https://electric-examples-app.fly.dev/
	- Old demo app: https://electric-demo.fly.dev/ (these are being migrated into tutorials)
-
- # Starter app repos
	- [Electric starter app](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app)
	- [Electric XTDB starter](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-xtdb-starter)

- # How to jack in your Clojure REPL
	- Jack in with `dev` alias
		- **do NOT let your editor auto-start a shadow-cljs build, just use an ordinary Clojure REPL**
			- It's critical that shadow-cljs share the same JVM as your editor REPL, otherwise the Electric frontend and backend code will disalign and you will see weird errors!
	- run `(main)` from `user.clj` to compile and serve the app
		- (main) will run shadow
		- see [user.clj](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app/blob/main/src/user.clj) and [user.cljs](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app/blob/main/src/user.cljs) in the starter app

- # IDE setup
	- [[Cursive IDE setup]]
	- [[Emacs IDE setup]]
	- [[Calva IDE setup]]
	- use shadow hot code reloading
	- it's not enough to send form to repl, due to how the compiler works today (we can probably fix it)
	- deep def works, println works
