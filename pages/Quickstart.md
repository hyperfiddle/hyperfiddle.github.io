- 1. Read the [Electric Live Tutorial](https://electric-examples-app.fly.dev/)
- 2. Review the [Electric Live Demos](https://electric-demo.fly.dev/) (these are mostly migrated into tutorials but a few remain)
- 3. Clone one of the starter apps:
	- [Electric starter app](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app)
	- [Electric XTDB starter](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-xtdb-starter)
- 4. "Jack-in" your editor into a project Clojure REPL
-
- ## How to jack in your Clojure REPL?
	- Jack in with `dev` alias
		- **do NOT let your editor auto-start a shadow-cljs build, just use an ordinary Clojure REPL**
			- It's critical that shadow-cljs share the same JVM as your editor REPL, otherwise the Electric frontend and backend code will disalign and you will see weird errors!
	- run `(main)` from `user.clj` to compile and serve the app
		- (main) will run shadow
		- see [user.clj](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app/blob/main/src/user.clj) and [user.cljs](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app/blob/main/src/user.cljs) in the starter app

- ## IDE setup
	- [[Cursive IDE setup]]
	- [[Emacs IDE setup]]
	- [[Calva IDE setup]]
	- use shadow hot code reloading
	- it's not enough to send form to repl, due to how the compiler works today (we can probably fix it)
	- deep def works, println works
