- 4 layers
	- Missionary - FRP for Clojure/Script
		- convergence of design
			- structured concurrency
				- structured programming
				- async/await vs callbacks
				- composition
					- pipelining function calls
		- functional programming
			- effect supervision
			- IO monads
		- reactive programming / FRP
			- continuous signals, discrete streams
			- backpressure, laziness
		- Process supervision
			- resource cleanup guarantees
	- Photon - web app as a functional expression
		- Mission – why are web programs stuck in the tarpit? accidental complexity?
		- Problem

		- Composable client/server UI
			- mark client and server regions
			- build in network management into the language and runtime
			- Follows the laws of fn composition
		- Programs are DAGs
	- HFQL – UI Modeling Language
	- Hyperfiddle – UI Notebook for Programmers
- Innovators dilemma
	- start with an inconsequential problem that is adjacent to a hidden huge problem
		- facebook, twitter
		- web browser
	- What are the huge problems we solve?
		- web data sync
		- UI
		- CRUD apps, esp enterprise database apps
		- tools for thought
	- Inconsequential problems?
		- "internal tools" / Retool
		- airtable / graph spreadsheet (relational sheet with web data types)
		- UI for smart contracts
